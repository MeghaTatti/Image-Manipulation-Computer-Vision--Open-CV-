# Image-Manipulation-Computer-Vision--Open-CV-
The program is to perform a simple image manipulation using Open CV.

We write a program to perform simple image manipulation using OpenCV. The program loads
an image by either reading it from a file or capturing it directly from the camera. The input can
be an image of a certain generic formats which performs various tasks such as cycling through
different color channels, converting it to a grayscale, the original image in different windows
with RGB colors. Sampling the images with the implementation smoothing, rotating with
respect to an angle at a given axis, translate and scale it up and down, using filters to remove
noises in the images and for further enhancing of images.

The basic algorithm starts with giving an image of certain dimensions and format that is then
being altered with respect to different co-ordinate systems.
For a particular image which is either uploaded from the directory or captured live using a
webcam, it can be processed using different functionalities as below:

Step 1: start

Step 2: select an option

Step 3: image is uploaded or captured via webcam

Step 4: As per the option selected, the function performing the operation are called
